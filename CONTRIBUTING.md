   # Then create a Pull Request on GitHub
   ```

## üìù Coding Standards

### Python Style Guide
- Follow [PEP 8](https://pep8.org/) style guidelines
- Use [Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/) for code formatting
- Use [isort](https://pycqa.github.io/isort/) for import sorting
- Use [flake8](https://flake8.pycqa.org/) for linting

### Code Quality Requirements
- **Test Coverage**: Minimum 80% coverage for new code
- **Documentation**: All public functions must have docstrings
- **Type Hints**: Use type hints for function parameters and returns
- **Error Handling**: Proper exception handling with meaningful messages

### Commit Message Format
Use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) format:
```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

Types:
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks

## üß™ Testing Guidelines

### Test Types
1. **Unit Tests**: Test individual functions and classes
2. **Integration Tests**: Test component interactions
3. **End-to-End Tests**: Test complete user workflows
4. **Ethical Tests**: Test for bias, fairness, and safety

### Writing Tests
```python
import pytest
from src.models.emotion_detector import EmotionDetector

def test_emotion_detection_positive_text():
    """Test emotion detection with positive text."""
    detector = EmotionDetector()
    detector.load_model()
    
    result = detector.detect_emotion("I feel amazing today!")
    
    assert result.emotion in ['joy', 'happiness']
    assert result.confidence > 0.7
    assert 'positive' in result.risk_factors
```

### Running Tests
```bash
# Run all tests
make test

# Run specific test file
python -m pytest tests/test_emotion_detector.py

# Run with coverage
make test-coverage

# Run ethical/bias tests
make test-ethics
```
